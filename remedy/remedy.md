##### Where we are #####
<br>
### Healthcare is the biggest issue of our time. ###
The Affordable Care Act will be Obama's great legacy. It's the most important issue of our time. And a revolution is afoot.

Innovations around bundled payments are inverting industry economics and puting patients back at the center. It started with Medicare, but that is just the beginning. 

It's time to bring humanity back to healthcare.

##### Who we are #####
<br>
## Metapattern is a studio for emergent design. ##
We are immersive storytellers: a nimble, multidisciplinary creative team rooted in rapid prototyping, identity design and filmmaking. We believe in working light and fast until things become ripe, then going deep to harvest. 

We work with Fortune 100 innovation teams, including Nike, GE, Levi's, and Cisco to rapid-prototype their future and communicate it internally.  We work with startups to craft strategic direction and launch products.  We work with leaders and teams to create culture and build alignment. We love the people we work with.

Our process *is* our work. We embed to get close to the heartbeat.  Distilling the eternal to understand next steps.  And build things by taking away the nonessential.  Always with an eye for what's wanting to emerge.

We are Metapattern.
