##### Where we are #####
<br>
### Healthcare is the biggest issue of our time. ###
The Affordable Care Act will be Obama's great legacy. It's the most important issue of our time. 

A revolution is afoot. Innovations around bundled payments are inverting industry economics and puting patients back at the center. It started with Medicare, but that is just the beginning. 

It's time to bring humanity back to healthcare.

##### Who you are #####
<br>
## Remedy Partners blends deep expertise with a spirit of innovation. ##
Your team has defined an industry once already. Blending incredible expertise across sectors: venture capital, finance, technology, public policy, and healthcare with a fast growing, young and ambitious team.

Capable, caring, and cutting edge: this is a truly modern healthcare company. 

You are the remedy.

##### Who we are #####
<br>
## Metapattern is a studio for emergent design. ##
We are immersive storytellers: a nimble, multidisciplinary creative team rooted in rapid prototyping, identity design and filmmaking. We believe in working light and fast until things become ripe, then going deep to harvest. 

We work with Fortune 100 innovation teams, including Nike, GE, Levi's, and Cisco to rapid-prototype their future and build momentum behind it.  We work with startups to craft strategic direction and get to market gracefully.  We work with leaders and teams to create culture and build alignment. We love the work we do and who we do it with.

Our process *is* our work. We embed to get close to the heartbeat.  Distilling the eternal to understand next steps.  And build things by taking away the nonessential.  Always with an eye for what's wanting to emerge.

We are Metapattern.

##### Where we're going #####
<br>
## What's possible together? ##

The curiosity we cultivate in truly understanding your work will live on in a media that your entire company, today and tomorrow, can revist and build on. 


#### Lead a revolution. ####
*(through the power of story)*

We will champion human-centered healthcare, driecting the difinitive short film that reveals and crystallizes the revolution that's already taking place. Our story moves between single patient and doctor stories to reveal the difference in user experience, out to the industry as a whole and the economic reform taking place through bundled payments and episodic care.  


#### Build a culture of passion. ####
(through interactive storytelling).

We will build Remedy's culture by creating a core identity and communicating it internally through an integrated microsite.  When you're hiring 5-10 new people per week, you'll have a compelling tool for onboarding and educating them about Remedy's deep purpose. It'll build alignment, trust, solidarity, excitement, and a shared understanding amongst current and future employees, and will help you attract and retain the best talent in the industry.


#### Launch a world-class brand. ####
*(through simple, clear design)*

We will build a brand that signals Remedy as the the future of health.

##### What's next #####
<br>
# Let's start simply. #
We will do so much work, the culture building assets which no one else does. We'll build a video and your culture alone with it.

Let's bring humanity back to healthcare.
